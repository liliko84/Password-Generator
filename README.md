# Password-Generator
First I made query selector for generate and copy button.made the function with length variable and the alert of the number.in order to have both letters an numbers in the password.Then listed all the characters and for that I made different variables with the names with console.log.
created an empty array to hold character bank and then the variable to check if the user wanted to use the any of the lister characters and added the push method to the array.
looped through the password length selecting all the characters each time and finally return password and joined it together as a string.
the last couple steps were functions about generating the password and copy button, adding event.listener to it.
